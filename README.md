## 💡 Why op-market Exists

Most e-commerce tutorials teach you how to *assemble* a store out of pre-built libraries — a UI kit here, a state manager there, a data-fetching library to glue it together. **op-market takes the opposite approach.**

The frontend ships with exactly **three** runtime dependencies: `react`, `react-dom`, and `react-router-dom`. Everything else — the caching layer, the toast notifications, the modal system, the form validation, even the SVG icons — is built from scratch. Not because good libraries don't exist, but because understanding *how* they work, at the level of `useSyncExternalStore`, focus traps, and cache invalidation strategies, makes you a fundamentally stronger engineer than importing a package and reading its docs.

The backend takes security and correctness just as seriously: rotating refresh tokens, rate limiting, Zod-validated input on every route, and a Prisma schema designed to prevent the exact class of bugs (stale cache, race conditions, silent data loss) that sink real production apps.

This is a real, shippable online store — and a deep-dive reference for how one actually gets built, end to end.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🛍️ Customer Experience

- Debounced product search with server-side pagination

- Full shopping cart with real-time quantity updates (race-condition safe)

- Guest browsing with seamless auth-gated checkout redirects

- **Dual payment flows**: Cash on Delivery *and* full PayPal Checkout integration (create → approve → capture/cancel)

- Persistent, editable shipping & billing addresses

- Order history with live status tracking and cancellation

- Fully responsive, mobile-first design with zero layout-shift image loading

### 🔐 Authentication & Security

- JWT access tokens + rotating, revocable refresh tokens (httpOnly cookies only — never exposed to JS)
  
- Email verification and secure password-reset flows via transactional email
  
- Automatic silent token refresh with request de-duplication (no duplicate refresh storms)
  
- Role-based route guards (`USER` / `ADMIN`) mirrored precisely on frontend and backend

### 🛠️ Admin Dashboard

- Full CRUD for products, including Cloudinary-backed image uploads
  
- Order management with status workflows (`PENDING → ACCEPTED → OUT_FOR_DELIVERY → DELIVERED`)
  
- User management with role promotion/demotion — with a built-in safeguard against locking yourself out of your own admin panel
  
- Responsive sidebar navigation with a mobile drawer

### ⚙️ Engineering Highlights

- **Custom Map-based cache system** with subscribe/notify — no re-render storms, no external state library
  
- **Three deliberate cache-invalidation strategies** (exact-key, prefix-wide, in-place merge) chosen per mutation, not applied blindly
  
- Route-level **code splitting** via `React.lazy` — the admin panel never ships to anonymous shoppers
  
- Full accessibility pass: focus traps, skip links, `aria-live` regions, keyboard-navigable everything
  
- SEO-conscious: per-page meta tags, canonical links, JSON-LD structured data, `robots.txt`/`sitemap.xml`
  
- **300+ automated tests** with Vitest + React Testing Library across hooks, components, and integration flows

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** `v18` or higher
  
- **npm** `v9` or higher
  
- **PostgreSQL** `v14` or higher (a local instance or a hosted one like Supabase/Neon/Railway)
  
- **Git**
  
- A free [PayPal Developer](https://developer.paypal.com/) sandbox account
  
- A free [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) account (for product image uploads)
  
- A free [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/) account (for transactional emails)

## 🔧 Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onepiece-coding/op-market-shop.git

cd op-market-shop
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

npm install

# create your local environment file

cp .env.example .env

# now fill in DATABASE_URL, JWT secrets, PayPal/Cloudinary/Brevo keys — see below

# generate the Prisma client and apply migrations

npx prisma generate

npx prisma migrate dev

# start the API in development mode

npm run dev
```

The API will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../frontend

npm install

# create your local environment file

cp .env.example .env

# set VITE_API_BASE_URL to your running backend, e.g.:

# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1

npm run dev
```

The app will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. (First-time only) Create your admin account

The **very first account** ever registered on a fresh database is automatically granted the `ADMIN` role — no manual database editing required. Sign up through the app, verify your email, and you're in.

## 💻 Usage Examples

**Authenticating and fetching your profile via the API:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

  -c cookies.txt \

  -d '{"email": "you@example.com", "password": "yourpassword"}'

curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/me -b cookies.txt
```

**Using the frontend's custom data-fetching hook inside any component:**

```typescript
import { useFetch } from "@/hooks/useFetch";

import { searchProducts } from "@/api/products";

import { cacheKeys } from "@/cache/cacheKeys";

function FeaturedProducts() {

  const { data, isLoading, error } = useFetch(

    cacheKeys.products.search({ limit: 8 }),

    () => searchProducts({ limit: 8 }),

  );

  if (isLoading) return <Spinner />;

  if (error) return <p>Something went wrong.</p>;

  return data.data.map((product) => (

    <ProductCard key={product.id} product={product} />

  ));

}
```

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
# backend

cd backend && npm run test

# frontend

cd frontend && npm run test
```

Both suites run with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and include unit, integration, and component-level tests.
